With a few years growing, the brand, which started at Halifax, an east coast city of Canada, has already built up two sea cucumber fishing bases both on Halifax and Vancouver, west coast of Canada. Moreover, by tracing and supervising the whole process, from wild fishing to processing, packaging, and other producing activities, SEACOO has achieved a high standard on food safety. Therefore, SEACOO is the only company that owns the certifications from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) for its two food processing plants，which respectively set on the Halifax, NS and Alberny, Vancouver Island, BC. By 2020, those factories have processed more than 6 million pounds of Arctic sea cucumber, as well as more than 200,000 pounds of Alaska Sea Cucumber.':

		"A) Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture mean the harvesting and farming of fish stocks in a manner that meets the needs of the present without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs. Instead of fishing unrestrainedly or causing a heavy load to the ocean, we insist on sustainably developing our fishing industry by addressing ecosystem considerations and using a scientific-based approach to managing our resources. We partner with family fisheries who follow strict guidelines set by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans by supporting ocean biodiversity through a conscientious approach to Sea Cucumber harvest. In more detail, we screen carefully and return the un-grown marine life to the ocean in every time of fishing, to ensure that they have enough time to grow. At the same time, we employ environmentally friendly processes to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, not only for contributing our power to the sustainable development of the marine but also to ensure our products are produced in high-quality and safe standards.
